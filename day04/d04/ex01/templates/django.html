<h1>What is Django?</h1>
<p>Django is a Python-based web framework which allows you to quickly create web application
without all of the installation or dependency problems that you normally will find with other frameworks.
When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components:
a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out),
a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use.
